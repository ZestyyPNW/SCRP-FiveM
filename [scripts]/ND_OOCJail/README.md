## Installation

### 1. Add to server.cfg

```cfg
ensure ND_OOCJail
```

Make sure it's loaded AFTER:
- ND_Core
- ox_lib

### 2. Configure

Edit `config.lua` and set:

```lua
Config.Discord = {
    ServerId = "934502096831672390", -- Your Discord server ID
    RoleName = "Awaiting Staff Judgment", -- Discord role name
    BotAPIUrl = "http://localhost:3000", -- Discord bot API endpoint
    BotToken = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" -- Not used by FiveM
}
```

Edit permission roles:
```lua
Config.Permissions = {
    AdminRoles = { "Admin", "Senior Admin", "Head Admin" },
    JudgeRoles = { "Judge", "Staff Judge", "Admin", "Senior Admin", "Head Admin" }
}
```

Adjust jail location if needed (default is Mission Row PD cells):
```lua
Config.JailLocation = {
    x = 461.88,
    y = -994.54,
    z = 24.91,
    heading = 89.76
}
```

### 3. Start Discord Bot

See `OOCJail-DiscordBot/README.md` for bot setup instructions.

### Jailing a Player

1. Admin types `/oocjail` in-game
2. Select player from list
3. Click "Send to OOC Jail"
4. Enter reason (min 10 characters)
5. Player is immediately jailed and Discord role is assigned

### Unjailing a Player
